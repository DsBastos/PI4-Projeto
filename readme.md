## üíª About

Project developed for my university course and a enterprise.

For this project we proposed together with the company VISION4YOU a solution to develop and implement a digital platform to simplify the relationship between visitors and local agents.

For this we have as objectives, increase knowledge about the territory and the theme of sustainability among local actors related to tourism, and increase the benefits of tourism for the local economy. Offer visitors a quality experience, promote genuine tourism products that allow visitors to discover, understand and establish a relationship with the territory.

And to achieve these goals we will have to divide the project into three main components, a backoffice portal, web application and finally an application for mobile devices.

In this repository you will find backend e backoffice projects.
